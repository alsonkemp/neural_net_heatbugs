= Neural Net Heatbugs

This is an old project which some folks might find of interest, so I'm
putting it up on GitHub.  MIT licensed.  It's an old and heavily incremented
project which I never expected anyone to see.  I've added docs to the code, but
I'm not proud of the code quality.  

Brief description:

    * This is RePast's heatbugs agent simulation that's been sexed up with genetic algorithms, neural networks, etc.
    *

== Heatbugs

Simple: each agent should move around to find the spot that gets them the perfect temperature.
    * There are a number of heatsources on the grid.

== Build + Run

You probably don't *need* NetBeans to build it, but I've only ever used NetBeans, so:
    * Open the project in NetBeans and run it...

== You should try...

== Architecture

Terminology:
